   - Each profile can be customized with unique settings such as naming conventions, pricing lists, warehouse assignments, and more.

2. **User Assignments:**
   - POS Profiles can be assigned to specific users, ensuring that salespeople only have access to relevant configurations.
   - This assignment ensures that transactions are processed smoothly with minimal errors, as users are presented with the interface and settings that match their role and location.

3. **Pricing and Discounts:**
